Hi Sir,

I came across the Associate Software Engineer position on LinkedIn and was excited by the opportunity. With my background in Python, SQLite, JS, React JS and Node JS, Iâ€™m confident I can contribute effectively to your team.

I've attached my resume for your consideration. Looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can add value to your organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Kondaveti Venkata Surya Uma Mahesh
